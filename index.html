            Laying out elements in CSS is something that used to be pretty
            difficult to do. We were forced to use annoying hacks like floating
            elements with clearfixes, but then flexbox was created. Flexbox
            revolutionized CSS layouts and is by far one of the most defining
            features of CSS to come out in the last 10 years. In this article I
            will teach you exactly what flexbox is, how you can use it, and all
            the advanced nuances you need to understand.
          </p>
          <h2>What Is Flexbox?</h2>
          <p>
            Flexbox is a way to layout elements in CSS and is broken into a two
            main components. The flexbox container and flexbox items. The
            flexbox container is the parent element that contains all the
            flexbox items as its children. The flexbox container is where you
            define all your properties about the flexbox layout and then on the
            individual items you can make additional tweaks. Let's take a look
            at how we would get started with a simple flexbox example. If we
            have an element with children inside of it all we need to do is set
            the display property of the parent element to flex and we will have
            a flex container. <span class="code">display: flex</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see by default when we specify a display of flex on an
            element we are setting that element as the flex container. All the
            direct children in that element are then considered flex items. By
            default if you specify no other properties the flex items will lay
            themselves out on one line from left to right taking up only as much
            space as they need. Items will also automatically shrink down to fit
            within the flex container if they would normally overflow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now this is the absolute basics of flexbox and on its own isn't
            really useful so next we need to talk about how to handle the layout
            of items in the container.
          </p>
          <h2>Flexbox Layout</h2>
          <p>
            Flexbox was the first CSS layout method that worked in a completely
            different way than normal CSS. Instead of worrying about
            block/inline elements flexbox worries about a main axis and a cross
            axis.
          </p>
          <p>
            By default the main axis (shown in green) goes horizontally across
            the container and the cross axis goes vertically. This means that
            any layout method that deals with the main axis will layout elements
            horizontally while the cross axis will layout elements vertically.
            Let's look at how we can layout elements along the main axis first.
          </p>
          <h2>Flex Item Layout</h2>
          <p>
            So far everything we have covered has had to deal with the layout of
            the entire flex container. We can actually take this a step further,
            though, and have specific layouts for each item in the flex
            container. This is done via the
            <span class="code">align-self</span> property.
          </p>
          <h2>Sizing Flex Items</h2>
          <p>
            Now we come to what is probably the most confusing part of flexbox
            which is sizing the individual items, but I promise you I will make
            it as easy as possible to understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real power of flexbox is not in its layout properties (even
            though, those are amazing), but in its ability to resize items based
            on the size of other elements on your page. This is done via 3
            different properties <span class="code">flex-grow</span>,
            <span class="code">flex-shrink</span>, and
            <span class="code">flex-basis</span>. First I want to talk about
            <span class="code">flex-grow</span> since it is the most common
            property you will use.
          </p>
          <h2>Flex Wrapping</h2>
          <p>
            When you are working in flexbox you are usually working with just
            one line of items, but sometimes in rare occasions you may want to
            handle wrapping when you have more items than you can fit on one
            line.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since our items have a width of 50% normally they would shrink to
            ensure they all fit on one line, but we set the
            <span class="code">flex-wrap</span> property to
            <span class="code">wrap</span> which means that if an item would
            overflow the container it is instead put on a new line. This is fine
            if you are using wrap to ensure that even if your list of items
            grows to be too large they still will look good, but if you are
            using wrapping to create a two dimensional layout you are using
            flexbox wrong. Instead you should look towards using CSS grid. You
            can check out my

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            And finally we come to the end of the ultimate guide to flexbox. I
            know this was a ton of information to cover, but hopefully at least
            some of it stuck. I know it is impossible to memorize all this at
            once, but you can continually come back to this article for quick
            refreshers on what each property does. I also am planning to create
            a cheat sheet soon that will cover all flexbox properties/values
            with nice drawings to go along with them. If that is something you
            are interested in make sure you sign up for my newsletter at the top
            of the page to be notified when I finish the cheat sheet.
